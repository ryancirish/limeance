# Consortium

### Rules:
- dont fucking share the link

How this works:
Notes via git commit, links to various resources, books. Basically just a repository of knowledge and analysis.

If you dont know git [learn](http://think-like-a-git.net/sections/graph-theory/seven-bridges-of-konigsberg.html), mix with [this](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) to learn the commands. Once you get up to speed we will determine the commit strategy. (both will also be annotated and filed in the appropriate section)

All documentation should be formatted in [markdown](http://assemble.io/docs/Cheatsheet-Markdown.html). 

If you have specific topics you think we should research please let me know at any time and we can dedicate a branch or series of commits to the subject at hand.

[Something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARrNYyJEnFI&t=3353s) to sink your teeth into as we get started (I will be annotating this first most likely and run through the series)
## Roadmap

- Finance
This is very broad but at first I would like to start with valuation, and the history of our banking system and its structure. Also evaluating securities and learning about structure of futures, fx, options markets.
- Economics
Fundementals, will mirror a curriculum maybe examine something exotic like LSE and see what theyre packing
- Trading
private repo most likely
- Cryptocurrency
Whitepapers, analysis, stat analysis
- General / Psych
cs resources, psych books, misc

Operations wise, in the short term I will create a slack for the group where we can discuss some of these projects...then automate archiving in repo via slack bot

Eventually might archive investopedia but I want to build something to scrape, long term project.

Also might place on a private portal eventually maybe private webapp at first then app

Going to do a bookmarks dump within the next week, but in the meantime I will place the links I had in mind within the next day or two

Enjoy and hml if you see this
